		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>The Jagadguru Veerasimhaasana Peetha established in the 11th Century A.D. at Suttur by Adi Jagadguru Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamiji has a history dating back to 1000 years, according to the scriptures. Suttur is a village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysore district in Karnataka. It is about 28 km from Mysore city, in the south east direction.</p>
		<p>The Peetha with its high ideals has been making remarkable contribution in religious, social, educational and economic spheres in the state and across the country. It is striving for social development by responding to the community needs. It strongly believes that unless the problems of the socially backward communities and the poor are solved, there cannot be any social development. With this objective, it has taken up several development initiatives, while at the same time living up to its principle of `work is worship’ and is engaged in raising public awareness on issues of social concern.</p>
		<p>The establishment of the Samskritha Paathashala by the 22nd Peethadheeshwara (Pontiff) Sri Shivarathreeshwara Mahaswamiji who was popularly known as the Mantra Maharshi might be called a landmark in the history of the Sree Math. When the 23rd Peethadheeshwara (Pontiff) Jagadguru Dr. Sri Shivaratri Rajendra Mahaswamiji came to Mysore in 1926 to pursue higher education, he observed that many rural students were in need of food and shelter. He gave them shelter at his own place and this marked the beginning of offering education to poor students. As far back as 1942, he established a hostel and offered free food and hostel facilities for poor rural students. This marked Sree Math’s first step in the field of development of the society.</p>
